    <h3>My Life at 27</h3>

    <p>
      For 27 years, I've been like a leaf blowing in the wind - going wherever
      life takes me, never making real choices. Sometimes I'd think, "I should
      take control," but the feeling always faded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I discovered AI. First ChatGPT, then DeepSeek. Seeing how these
      systems "think" amazed me. They weren't perfect, but they tried - they
      processed information, they learned. And that's when it hit me:
    </p>

    <p>
      These smart machines were made by humans. Humans who decided to create, to
      build, to think. But me? I was just watching life go by.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, for the first time, I feel excited about something - technology. I
      want to learn web development, even if people say I'm too old or it's too
      late. Maybe I'll even work with AI someday.
    </p>

    <p>
      The difference? This time, I'm not just drifting. This time, I'm choosing.
